I realized that the above was based on this season's data so far

```{r}

# Read the dataset
pitch_data2022 <- read.csv("C:/Users/cplay/Downloads/pitch_tempo_2022.csv")
```

```{r}

# Plot the data
ggplot(pitch_data, aes(x = median_seconds_empty)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.5, fill = ifelse(pitch_data$median_seconds_empty > 15, "blue", "gray"), color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 12.5, linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 15, linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = 12.5, y = 0.25, label = "Current MLB average:\n12.5 seconds", hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", x = 15, y = 0.25, label = "MLB's 15-SECOND\nCUTOFF", hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "59 pitchers wouldn't meet the new bases-empty pitch clock",
       subtitle = "Average pitch time for MLB pitchers when the bases were empty, 2022",
       x = "Time (in seconds)",
       y = "",
       caption = "Among pitchers who qualified for the pitches leaderboard.\nSource: Baseball Savant") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

Overall I wasn't totally satisfied with this output so I asked GPT if they could replicate something better.

```{r}

# Classify the pitchers based on the 15-second cutoff
pitch_data <- pitch_data %>%
  mutate(Classification = ifelse(median_seconds_empty > 15, "Above 15 Seconds", "Below 15 Seconds"))
```

```{r}

# Identify Giovanny Gallegos
gallegos_time <- pitch_data %>%
  filter(entity_name == "Freeland, Kyle") %>%
  select(median_seconds_empty) %>%
  pull()

# Plot the data
ggplot(pitch_data, aes(x = median_seconds_empty)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.1, fill = ifelse(pitch_data$median_seconds_empty > 15, "blue", "gray"), color = "white", dotsize = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 12.5, linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 15, linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 12.5, y = 0.05), label = "Current MLB average:\n12.5 seconds", hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 15, y = 0.05), label = "MLB's 15-SECOND\nCUTOFF", hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(x = gallegos_time, y = 0.15), label = "Giovanny Gallegos", hjust = 1, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "59 pitchers wouldn't meet the new bases-empty pitch clock",
       subtitle = "Average pitch time for MLB pitchers when the bases were empty, 2022",
       x = "Time (in seconds)",
       y = "",
       caption = "Among pitchers who qualified for the pitches leaderboard.\nSource: Baseball Savant") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

This came out better but ultimately not exactly like the graph.
