title: "About me"
---

My name is **Cameron Playle**, a passionate Data Analyst with a diverse background spanning healthcare, commercial real estate and sport analytics. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Health Science from Texas A&M University and am in my penultimate semester of my Master's of Science in Data Analytics degree at the University of Texas at San Antonio. My journey through different industries has equipped me with a broad set of skills and experiences, but my ultimate passion lies in baseball operations and research and development.

I specialize in data-driven decision-making, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis, with a passion for baseball analytics. My experience includes working with the UTSA baseball team where I contribute to performance data analysis and develop predictive models to enhance player development. My current research focuses on predicting injury risks, such as Tommy John surgery, using logistic regression and machine learning models, while also evaluating performance metrics that help teams optimize their strategies.

Skilled in Python, R, and SQL, I leverage data visualization to communicate complex insights clearly and effectively. I have experience working with various baseball datasets, including Statcast and Trackman, to help teams and players unlock their full potential. Whether it's building machine learning models, optimizing data pipelines, or exploring new ways to analyze performance data, I'm excited to push the boundaries of what's possible in sports science.

My ultimate goal is to leverage my diverse analytics background in a fast-paced, innovative environment, where I can contribute to cutting-edge baseball R&D. By helping teams make data-driven decisions, I aim to advance player performance and development, while working collaboratively to bring out the best version of every athlete, coach, and colleague.
